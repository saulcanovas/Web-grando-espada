                    Continent.
                    
                    So Admiral tried to find substitutes and tested them out.
                    
                    He always ends up making the worst dishes… However the real problem is that he always gives them to me.
                    
                    I wish he will stop this soon, but he seems really determined.
                    
                    Some pioneers who do not know about the Admiral unwittingly become his dish testers. Oh, you have such bad luck today.."

                <p>
                    The Pioneering Officer will tell you to throw away the dish. When you go back to Admiral Nunez, quest will be completed.

                Let's go to the Ustiur Base Camp.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You need to take a ship by talking to the ticket officer in the center port of Coimbra.
                    
                    Ticket officer sells a free pass for 'Pinta'
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    If you bought the ticket, go on shipboard by talking to ticket officer again.
                    (You don't need to buy a free pass several times)

                <p>
                    Before you go to Ustiur, a sub-quest from Toribio will be added.
