                <h3>Three-Year War</h3>
                <p>
                    However, Opoluto over-extended its funding and was faced with bankruptcy. Another nation, Vespanola, cleared the
                    national debts and annexed Opoluto and its holdings in the New World. The people of Vespanola began to migrate
                    to
                    Granado Espada.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Three-Year War soon began between Bristia and Vespanola. The supplies to the New World ceased, halting all
                    pioneering efforts. Eventually, Vespanola's Red Navy miraculously defeated the more powerful Bristia's fleet,
                    ending
                    the
                    war in Vespanola's victory.

                    <p><em>Granado Espada Online</em> is set in the New World, a newly discovered land away from the old hub of
                        civilization. The back-drop is similar to the founding of America by Christopher Columbus during the Age of
                        Discovery. See History of Granado Espada for a more detailed timeline of game events.

                    <h3>Discovery of the New World</h3>
                    <p>
                        Around 70 years ago, the nation of Opoluto was in economic recession due to its trade with the nation of
                        Katai
                        being
                        cut
                        off by Targa. In response, Ferruccio Espada and his assistant, Gilberto Granado, sought a new oceanic trade
                        route
                        across
                        the Dark Sea to the West.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After 5 years, they finally reached an unknown land and named it Granado Espada. The new land is home to
                        exotic
                        species
                        of plants and animals. Ancient ruins littered the continent. His home country, Opoluto, saw the potential of
                        the
                        land
                        
                        and began development of the New World, building the first port called Porto Bello, which was later replaced
                        by
                        Port
                        of
                        Coimbra.

                <h3>Reconquista Policy</h3>
                <p>
                    To deal with the social problems caused by the war nobles in Vespanola, Queen Esperanza initiated the
                    Reconquista
                    Policy, sending them over to the New World. Thus, came the new wave of pioneers, seeking wealth, fame, and honor
                    in
                    the
                    New World of Granado Espada!
